# Research Papers — AI & Quantitative Finance

This repository collects **current and ongoing research** by **Alejandro Reynoso** at the frontier of **artificial intelligence and finance**.  
These papers are the **building blocks** behind my long-form books and teaching materials.

> **Methodological stance.** The research is **human-led**. AI tools assist with *literature triage, drafting, editing, code scaffolding,* and *formatting*, but **direction, design, validation, and accountability** remain human. Human intervention is **predominant** and the **ultimate responsibility** is mine.

> **Constraint as a feature.** All experiments are performed with **open-source tools** and **Google Colab**, operating under a **$20/month budget ceiling**. The aim is to demonstrate **high-value, reproducible** research without proprietary paywalls or heavy infrastructure.

- **Versioned PDFs via GitHub Releases** (stable, citable URLs)
- Optional **DOIs** via Zenodo
- Lightweight **metadata** per paper for indexing
- **Errata & updates** tracked transparently

# A Practical Guide to Implementing Reasoning Systems in Financial Institutions

**Author:** Alejandro Reynoso  
**Version:** v01 · **Release:** [`paper-practical_guide_reasoning_institutions-v01`](https://github.com/alexdibol/papers/releases/tag/paper-practical_guide_reasoning_institutions-v01)

## Abstract
This paper is a **fully researched set of best practices** for deploying **advanced reasoning models**—from chain-of-thought orchestration to agentic pipelines—**inside real-world financial institutions**. It distills practical guidance on architecture choices, governance and controls, risk & compliance alignment, data integration, evaluation/monitoring, and productionization under regulatory and operational constraints. The emphasis is on **institution-grade reliability, auditability, and reproducibility**, with patterns and checklists that technology, risk, and business teams can use to move from pilots to scalable impact.

# Advanced Sequential Reasoning

**Author:** Alejandro Reynoso  
**Version:** v01 · **Release:** [`papers-advanced_sequential_reasoning-v01`](https://github.com/alexdibol/papers/releases/tag/papers-advanced_sequential_reasoning-v01)

## Abstract
Financial decisions rarely unfold as a single, linear calculation. Prices co-move across horizons; credit signals deepen or recede as new information arrives; regimes flip the meaning of familiar indicators; and live data streams force analysts to adapt on the fly. This paper presents a **practitioner-first framework** that organizes these realities into four composable patterns:

1. **Multi-Timeline Analysis** — reconcile signals across intraday, swing, and strategic horizons.  
2. **Conditional Reasoning Chains** — branch only when prior evidence warrants escalation.  
3. **Scenario-Dependent Architectures** — select the right analytical playbook by regime.  
4. **Real-Time Sequential Adaptation** — reconfigure the analysis chain as the data-generating process shifts.

For each pattern, we provide rationale, step-by-step implementation guidance, performance and governance metrics, common failure modes, and change-management tips. Terminal-style **ASCII schemes** make logic portable to runbooks, PRDs, and code comments without layout friction. An appendix supplies a ready-to-use **prompt** that regenerates a Colab notebook implementing the full framework with clean terminal outputs and robust fallbacks. The goal is a fluid yet rigorous toolkit that helps portfolio managers, quants, risk leaders, and credit officers build systems that are **clear to operate, easy to audit, and hard to break**.
