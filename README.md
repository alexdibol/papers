# Research Papers — AI & Quantitative Finance

This repository collects **current and ongoing research** by **Alejandro Reynoso** at the frontier of **artificial intelligence and finance**.  
These papers are the **building blocks** behind my long-form books and teaching materials.

> **Methodological stance.** The research is **human-led**. AI tools assist with *literature triage, drafting, editing, code scaffolding,* and *formatting*, but **direction, design, validation, and accountability** remain human. Human intervention is **predominant** and the **ultimate responsibility** is mine.

> **Constraint as a feature.** All experiments are performed with **open-source tools** and **Google Colab**, operating under a **$20/month budget ceiling**. The aim is to demonstrate **high-value, reproducible** research without proprietary paywalls or heavy infrastructure.

- **Versioned PDFs via GitHub Releases** (stable, citable URLs)
- Optional **DOIs** via Zenodo
- Lightweight **metadata** per paper for indexing
- **Errata & updates** tracked transparently
